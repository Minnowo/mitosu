# mitosu

See into servers remotely over SSH.

`mitosu` is a remote system monitor inspired by [rtop](https://github.com/rapidloop/rtop).
It connects over SSH to a remote system and displays information (CPU, disk, memory, network, Docker containers).
No special software is needed on the remote system, other than an SSH server and working credentials.

Currently only Linux systems can be monitored, other system support is planned.
